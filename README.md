[00:06.69] I don't need ya
[00:09.16] Don't even miss ya
[00:11.66] But when I see ya
[00:13.91] I relapse
[00:18.86] And it's an issue that I can't get through
[00:23.73] Always brand new, every time you're back, hmm
[00:26.07] Honestly I'm good but I
[00:28.68] Know that l've been better l'm
[00:31.39] Sleeping pretty good at night
[00:33.60] But I ain't honest about it yet
[00:35.98] Every day I push you out
[00:38.51] Since the day we said goodbye
[00:41.15] Told myself that I was fine
[00:43.55] Can I be honest about it yet?
[00:45.22] 'Cause if I'm being honest
[00:47.68] Time isn't helping the slightest
[00:52.77] Every time I hear your name fight it, fight it off, make it stop
[00:57.64] Every time I see it holding her hand l'Il just beat it
[00:59.98] Hate that I get in my feelings
[01:03.46] Honestly don't know how to make it stop
[01:13.01] ♪
[01:15.40] There's a reason
[01:17.62] Why we're not speaking
[01:22.60] But I forget it everytime your infront of me, yeah
[01:24.99] Every day I push you out
[01:27.46] Since the day we said goodbye
[01:30.32] Told myself that I was fine
[01:32.55] Can I be honest about it yet?
[01:34.19] 'Cause if I'm being honest
[01:36.66] Time isn’t helping the slightest
[01:41.70] Every time I hear your name fight it, fight it off, make it stop
[01:46.71] Every time I see it holding her hand l'Il just beat it
[01:48.79] Hate that I get in my feelings
[02:02.22] Honestly don't know how to make it stop
[02:04.74] Please, don't hold her like that in front of me
[02:07.41] I love your hands but not with her in between
[02:09.71] How could you promise and say, "She ain't it"
[02:12.93] But the second we're over you break it
[02:14.65] 'Cause if I'm being honest
[02:17.06] Time isn't helping the slightest
[02:21.95] Every time I hear your name fight it, fight it off, make it stop
[02:27.02] Every time I see it holding her hand l'Il just beat it
[02:29.50] Hate that I get in my feelings
[02:33.52] Honestly don't know how to make it stop
[02:35.03] 'Cause if I'm being honest
[02:36.32] If I'm being
[02:37.52] If I'm being honest
[02:38.69] If I'm being
[02:40.00] If I'm being honest
[02:43.37] Honest, yeah, yeah
[02:44.72] 'Cause if I'm being honest
[02:45.68] If I'm being
[02:47.12] If I'm being honest
[02:48.35] If I'm being
[02:49.85] If I'm being honest
Can I be honest about it yet?
